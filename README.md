# Mental-Health-Prediction-
📌 Project Overview
Mental health is an essential component of overall well-being, and it is even more important in today’s modern workplace culture. This particular project aims to design a Machine Learning-based system known as the “Mental Health Prediction System” to determine if any person requires treatment regarding their mental health.

The goal of the system is to facilitate early intervention, overcome stigma, and foster an healthier and more productive community using data insights while adhering to the ethics and privacy of the users.

🎯 Purpose
-The main intention of this project is to:
-Develop a model that predicts mental health treatment needs with machine learning algorithms
-Deliver a user-friendly and accessible platform
-Promoting early intervention and awareness broadcasting
-In line with the workplace mental health initiatives, there are steps
-Handle sensitive data in an ethical manner

🚀 Features
✅ Predicts likelihood of mental health treatment requirement
✅ Uses self-reported questionnaire data
✅ Machine learning–based predictive modeling
✅ User-friendly interface
✅ Privacy-aware and ethical data handling
✅ Scalable and explainable system design

🧩 Problem Statement
The traditional evaluation of mental health requires self-reporting and face-to-face analysis that can be subjective, inaccessible, and stigmatizing to some extent. This project solves the problem by creating an accurate, available, and predictive tool to assist in the identification of people in need of mental health care using machine learning techniques.
